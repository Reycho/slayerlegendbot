SlayerLegendBot
A python bot to play the indie game Slayer Legends for you.

This program is designed to run seamlessly on your preferred emulator, such as Bluestacks, at around 16:9 aspect ratio, I have tested 16:10 to also work, but any extreme values are not guaranteed to work.
It doesn't require any user input to function but offers an optional pause feature.
Below are the steps to get started.

Installation

    Download the Program: Begin by downloading the program as a zip file.

    Install Required Modules: Ensure that you have the necessary Python modules installed by opening your terminal and running the following commands in terminal:

    pip install pywin32
    pip install keyboard
    pip install pyautogui
    pip install opencv-python
    pip install inputimeout
    pip install schedule

Running the Program

    Double-click the .py File: After downloading and installing the required modules, locate the .py file in the downloaded folder and double-click it to run the program.

    Emulator Setup: Make sure your preferred emulator (e.g., Bluestacks) is running in full-screen mode before proceeding.

    Wait for Initialization: After launching the program, wait for approximately 5 seconds. If nothing happens during this time, proceed to the next step.

    Check for Error Messages: If you encounter any issues or errors, check the terminal or any error messages that may have popped up during program execution.

    Otherwise the console will tell you everything else.

Optional Features

    Pause Functionality: The program includes an optional pause feature. You can activate this pause feature within the program as needed if you need to roll for weapons or go to the mines.
